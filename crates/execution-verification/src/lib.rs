//! Verification semantics: what was asked, what was checked, what came back.
//!
//! # Why verification is not Boolean
//!
//! Phase 126 §6 established that the three zkVM substrates do not agree
//! about what a proof covers:
//!
//! ```text
//! SP1        does not commit to its input at all. SP1Stdin is never
//!            hashed and never reaches verify_proof, which checks
//!            version, exit code and public-values digest only.
//! RISC Zero  has a ReceiptClaim.input field, but Input is an
//!            UNINHABITED type; the only value that can reach it is a
//!            host-DECLARED input_digest, and Receipt::verify requires
//!            that digest to be zero.
//! Nexus      genuinely binds it -- verify_expected() reconstructs the
//!            whole execution View, input memory included.
//! ```
//!
//! Given `fn verify(proof, expectation) -> bool`, an SP1 backend returns
//! `true` having checked program and output only; a Nexus backend
//! returns the identical `true` having also checked the input. The
//! caller cannot tell them apart and is entitled to believe the stronger
//! claim in both cases -- Phase 111's failure mode (an unwarranted claim
//! entering through a gate that looks like it checked) reintroduced by
//! the abstraction itself. `Result<(), Error>` carries the same single
//! bit and fails identically.
//!
//! # The two Phase 128 repairs
//!
//! The Phase 128 adversarial review ran two probes against the Phase 127
//! version of this module and both drew blood:
//!
//! **The detachable warrant.** `Verified { coverage, proof, backend }`
//! did not name the expectation it satisfied. Verifying one artifact
//! against program A and against program B produced IDENTICAL result
//! objects: the warrant floated free of its proposition, and a later
//! reader could attach it to a claim it never checked. Phase 111 one
//! level up -- Phase 127 kept HOW MUCH was checked and discarded WHAT
//! was checked. Repair: every [`VerificationResult`] variant embeds the
//! [`Expectation`] it answered, and the sealed entry point embeds it, so
//! an adapter cannot mis-attach it.
//!
//! **Coverage inflation.** The Phase 127 entry point screened
//! capabilities BEFORE dispatch but returned the adapter's claimed
//! coverage verbatim -- an adapter whose own `capabilities()` said
//! `input_checked: false` answered `Verified` with `input_checked: true`
//! and it passed through. Repair: adapters no longer construct
//! [`VerificationResult`] at all. They return the narrower
//! [`AdapterVerdict`], and [`ProofBackend::verify`] assembles the result
//! itself: the proof identity is computed from the artifact actually
//! examined, the expectation is embedded verbatim, and claimed coverage
//! outside `capabilities()` or below the expectation's requirements is
//! refused as [`VerificationFailure::AdapterContractViolation`].
//!
//! What remains trusted -- and is stated as trusted rather than
//! disguised as verified -- is the adapter's word that its coverage
//! reflects what its backend's verifier actually enforced. That is the
//! trusted adapter boundary (`docs/ZKVM_ADAPTER_BOUNDARY.md`); it is
//! auditable by tamper-vector conformance tests, not provable from here.
