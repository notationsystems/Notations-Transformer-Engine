//! The four identities, the outcome vocabulary, and the occurrence.
//!
//! # Why there are four identities and not one
//!
//! Phase 126 found that the three zkVM substrates disagree about what an
//! execution even is: RISC Zero centres a claim digest, SP1 centres a
//! `(verifying key, public values)` pair, Nexus centres a reconstructible
//! `View`. Collapsing those into a single "execution id" would force one
//! backend's model onto the others.
//!
//! Four separate identities, each committing to exactly one thing, is
//! what all three can attach to:
//!
//! ```text
//! ProgramIdentity   what was to be run
//! InputIdentity     what it was to be run on
//! OutputIdentity    what came out
//! ProofIdentity     the artifact asserting the run happened
//! ```
//!
//! And one thing that is deliberately NOT an identity in that sense:
//!
//! ```text
//! ExecutionOccurrence   that a run happened, this time
//! ```
//!
//! # Backend-native commitments are not canonical identities
//!
//! A `ProgramIdentity` is *our* commitment to the program bytes. It is
//! NOT a RISC Zero ImageID, NOT an SP1 verifying-key hash, and NOT a
//! Nexus ELF. Phase 126 §5 is the reason:
//!
//! | substrate | program commitment | pure function of the ELF? |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | RISC Zero | 32-byte ImageID | yes |
//! | SP1 | verifying-key hash | derivable, but only via an expensive, circuit-version-bound `setup()` |
//! | Nexus | *none at all* -- the verifier is handed the whole ELF | n/a |
//!
//! One backend has no program digest whatsoever. A canonical identity
//! defined as "the backend's program commitment" would therefore be
//! undefined for Nexus and version-dependent for SP1. A backend's native
//! commitment belongs BESIDE our identity, as an opaque backend-tagged
//! value, never as the identity itself.
