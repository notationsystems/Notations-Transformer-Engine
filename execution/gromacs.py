"""GROMACS single-point energy: the first REAL scientific workload.

Runs `gmx grompp` -> `gmx mdrun` (nsteps=0) -> `gmx energy` over a
caller-supplied system and reports the potential energy -- through the
SAME `ExecutionSpecification` / `ExecutionResult` types and the same
identity discipline as the Rust engine, so a GROMACS computation and a
native-kernel computation are the same KIND of object to everything
downstream.

The dimension mapping (and why it is honest):

    program        the workload descriptor: engine name+version line and
                   the full topology bytes -- WHAT would be computed
    configuration  the .mdp bytes -- the parameters GOVERNING the run
    input          the .gro bytes -- the system the run is OVER

WHERE THIS SITS ON THE TRUST SPECTRUM -- weaker than the Rust engine,
and stated rather than blurred. The Rust engine echoes every identity
and is recomputed against (`execution/engine.py`); GROMACS knows nothing
of our identities, so every identity here is computed BY THIS MODULE
from bytes it holds. The coupling between the descriptor and gmx's
actual behavior is DECLARED (the descriptor's version line is trusted to
name the binary that ran -- verified against `gmx --version` output at
descriptor-build time, but nothing binds the binary at run time). This
is the native bytes-vs-behavior gap plus an external process. What the
workload still gains from the substrate: content-addressed request and
computation identities, refusal semantics, the operation ledger at the
dispatch seam, and an empirical repeat-determinism check in its tests.

DETERMINISM SCOPE: same binary, same machine -- exercised by running
twice and comparing computation identities. Bit-identical results ACROSS
machines are NOT claimed (this is floating-point code; the build pins
double precision and no SIMD, which helps and is not a proof). The
output bytes are gmx's OWN text for the energy value, taken verbatim
from the .xvg -- no float re-formatting on our side that could
introduce a second source of divergence.

COMPUTATION != MEASUREMENT applies with full force: a computed argon
pair energy is a computation about a model system. Nothing here measured
anything, and the dispatch declaration downstream says `simulation:`.
