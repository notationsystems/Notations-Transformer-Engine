"""Phase 119: declared execution vs witnessed execution.

This phase attacks the repair offered at the end of Phase 118. BOTH
PROPOSED REPAIRS ARE FALSIFIED, and the second falsification is the more
instructive one.

sec.1 A MANDATORY DECLARATION SEPARATES HONEST CALLERS FROM EACH OTHER,
NEVER HONEST FROM DISHONEST
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Six cases, every one supplying `extraction_method` EXPLICITLY:

    A genuine execution + correct declaration     obs 9da0d1ee...
    C no execution + measurement declaration      obs 9da0d1ee...
    D fabricated result + measurement declaration obs 9da0d1ee...
    E simulation + measurement declaration        obs 9da0d1ee...
    F human entry + measurement declaration       obs 9da0d1ee...
    B genuine execution + FALSE declaration       obs 9ce37887...

A, C, D, E and F ARE ONE OBJECT with ONE POOL FINGERPRINT. The only case
that differs is B -- where the caller told the TRUTH about a simulation.
Declaring honestly is the only act that changes the represented state.

So making the field mandatory removes a default and changes nothing else:
it forces a dishonest caller to type one string they were previously
given for free. The Phase 118 suggestion is FALSIFIED.

sec.2/sec.10 RESTRICTING THE CONSTRUCTOR DOES NOT HELP EITHER
---------------------------------------------------------------
Assume the stronger proposal: only a trusted execution primitive may mint
"measurement:campaign_execution". Two routes were compared:

    route 1  make_experimental_result -> admit_experimental_result
    route 2  make_observation(...) -> admit_observation

They produce THE SAME `Observation.id` -- not a similar object, the same
one. `make_observation` is public and takes `extraction_method` as a
plain argument. `make_claimed_relationship`/`admit_claimed_relationship`
are equally public, and their gates require only that the referents and
the observation exist in the pool, which they do by construction. So the
WHOLE of route 1, including the `tested_during` relationship, is
reproducible from evidence primitives alone.

A trusted path can only be trusted if it is the ONLY path. It is not, and
making it the only path would mean removing `make_observation` from the
public surface -- which is the primitive every honest ingestion route
(scout, experiment, workbench) is built from.

sec.6 WORLD A AND WORLD B ARE NOT INDISTINGUISHABLE. THEY ARE EQUAL.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Real instrument produces 123.4 MPa; nothing executes and a caller types
123.4 MPa. Field by field:

    Record.id       equal
    ExperimentalResult.id equal
    Observation.id  equal
    pool fingerprint equal
    epistemic status equal

Every represented field is equal, so there is no comparison to fail --
this is Phase 111b's result reached through the experiment abstraction
rather than the evidence primitives.

sec.5 WHAT IDENTITY TRACKS
---------------------------
    ONE event, TWO declarations   -> TWO identities
    TWO events, ONE declaration   -> ONE identity

Identity tracks WHAT THE CALLER SAYS HAPPENED, never what happened. That
is the sharpest statement of Phase 116b's identity-invariance table, and
it is why no amount of declaration discipline can produce a witness.

sec.4 THE FIVE PREDICATES

    D "someone declared a measurement"
    A "the value is attributed to a source"
    X "an execution occurred"
    O "an observation was produced"
    W "the execution occurred in the external world"

    D -> A   ESTABLISHED, and trivially: the Record cites a Document
             which cites a Source. Attribution is a citation, not a fact
             (Phase 111b).
    D -> X   FALSIFIED -- case C.
    X -> O   FALSIFIED -- a dispatcher may execute and the caller simply
             not call `admit_experimental_result`; world B of Phase 118
             leaves no trace either way.
    O -> X   FALSIFIED -- case C.
    A -> W   FALSIFIED (Phase 111b).
    X -> W   NOT EXPRESSIBLE -- X itself is unrepresented.
    O -> W   FALSIFIED.

One implication of seven holds, and it is the one that asserts least.

sec.7 THREE ROUTES, ONE ABSENCE
--------------------------------
    Phase 111  computation -> Record.raw_content -> Observation
    Phase 118  fabricated result -> ExperimentalResult -> Observation
    Phase 119  false declaration -> legitimate-looking Observation

These are NOT three vulnerabilities. They are three surfaces of ONE
absence: nothing in the system is a function of anything outside the
process. Phase 111b proved this is structural -- identity is a function
of content, authenticity is a function of history, and content does not
encode history. A fourth route would tell us nothing new.

sec.8 THE MISSING PREMISE, NAMED
----------------------------------
Phase 114 established EXECUTION AUTHORITY: `ActionDispatcher` is the one
place a physical experiment would be performed. That is AUTHORISATION TO
EXECUTE. It is not EVIDENCE THAT EXECUTION OCCURRED.

"Only the dispatcher may execute" does not imply "only the dispatcher may
truthfully produce a measurement" without the premise:

    every measurement-declaring object was produced BY the dispatcher,
    and that production is itself represented and checkable.

The second clause is the one that fails. `DispatchedMeasurement` has no
id (Phase 118), so even if a dispatcher did produce it, nothing
downstream could cite it as the producer. The premise is not merely
unproven; it is unstatable in the current object model.

sec.9 NO EXISTING OBJECT CAN WITNESS EXECUTION
------------------------------------------------
Every candidate was checked against what a witness must do -- be produced
by something other than the declaring caller, and be citable by the
object it warrants:

    DispatchedMeasurement  no id; cannot be cited (Phase 118)
    ExperimentalResult     content-hashed from the declaration itself
    Record                 the caller writes `raw_content`
    Source/Document        the caller writes both; no gate (Phase 111b)
    ModelState             a function of already-admitted samples
    PredictionAssessment   diagnostic, and downstream of admission
    ClaimedRelationship    requires an Observation that already exists

None is produced independently of the caller. There is no witness, and
naming one `ExecutionRecord` would not make it one -- Phase 116b already
falsified that candidate on three counts, and counterexample 3 applies
here verbatim: a recorded version string is itself a caller-written
claim.

sec.11 CLASSIFICATION

  required declaration establishes execution      FALSIFIED
  trusted construction path establishes execution FALSIFIED
  extraction_method records actual origin         FALSIFIED
  observation identity captures execution history FALSIFIED
  execution authority implies execution evidence  FALSIFIED
  ExperimentalResult is evidence of execution     FALSIFIED
  genuine and fabricated are distinguishable      FALSIFIED
  external-world authenticity is representable    FALSIFIED

Eight of eight.

sec.12 THE ANSWER TO THE FINAL QUESTION
-----------------------------------------
Asked what fact about the world would have to become represented: the
answer is NOT a new semantic object.

It is AN EXTERNAL TRUST ASSUMPTION THAT CANNOT BE ESTABLISHED
INTERNALLY. To distinguish World A from World B, some object would have
to be a function of an event outside the process -- an instrument
signature, a witnessed timestamp, a custody chain, a second party. Every
one of those is a fact the process must RECEIVE, and receiving it is
exactly the boundary that has no gate. A system whose identity is
content-addressed cannot manufacture a witness, because a hash cannot
witness what it was not given.

So:
    declaration  != attribution  != execution  != observation  != authenticity

and they collapse at exactly one point: THE MOMENT A VALUE IS WRITTEN
INTO A RECORD. Everything above that point is a function of what the
caller wrote. Everything the architecture does correctly -- immutability,
content-addressing, append-only history, the admission gates -- operates
entirely above that line and is untouched by this result.

CONSEQUENCE FOR PRODUCTION: none. Zero production changes, and the Phase
118 suggestion is WITHDRAWN: making `extraction_method` mandatory would
remove a misleading default without restoring any boundary, and should
not be justified on those grounds.
