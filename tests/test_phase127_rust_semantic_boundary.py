"""Phase 127 -- forward guards on the Rust execution semantic boundary.

The Rust substrate's own semantics are tested in Rust
(`crates/execution-core/tests/semantics.rs`, 30 tests). These are the
ARCHITECTURAL guards: they protect the shape of the boundary from
erosion, and they run in the Python suite so that a change to the Rust
layer cannot land without the repository's own test run noticing.

Every guard here works on EXTRACTED STRUCTURE -- function signatures
with comments and string literals removed, struct field lists, Cargo
dependency tables -- never on raw substring matching. That is not
fastidiousness: `crates/execution-verification/src/lib.rs` contains the
literal text `fn verify(proof, expectation) -> bool` inside its module
documentation, as the thing it argues AGAINST. A substring guard would
fire on the very sentence explaining why the guard exists. Roughly
eight lock tests in earlier phases had to be rewritten for exactly this
class of false positive.

What is guarded, and why each matters (Phase 126 §6, §10):

  verify(...) -> bool          would return an identical `true` for a
                               backend that checked the input and one
                               that did not
  Result<(), Error>            carries the same single bit
  backend serialization        SP1 bincode / RISC Zero words / Nexus
                               postcard+COBS are three incompatible
                               encodings; none may become ours
  verification/types.py        a Python verification model would compete
                               with the Rust one for authority
