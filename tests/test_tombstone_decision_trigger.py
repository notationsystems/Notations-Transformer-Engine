"""The tombstone decision has a deadline, and this is it.

THE DECISION, DEFERRED DELIBERATELY. `evidence_append_only` holds with no
tombstone semantics: payload retirement with retained identity and
provenance edges, and defeasance propagation to downstream canonical
claims, do not exist. So a revocation-compelling source cannot be
honestly onboarded. Taking the bend is a core version increment under
bend_protocol, not a patch.

It is deferred because no such source exists, and building for no
consumer is a proposal wearing measurement's clothes -- the discipline
that stopped the checker optimization at -6%.

WHY IT NEEDS A TRIGGER RATHER THAN A NOTE. The cost is not flat. Today
`EvidencePool` has no persistence layer and legacy records are 0, so the
bend is free: there is nothing stored to migrate and nothing that
predates the semantics. The moment records outlive a process, every
stored record predates them and retrofitting becomes structural.

So the window in which this decision stays cheap closes at a specific,
nameable event -- and a carried-forward note does not close with it. It
survives the event silently, which is exactly how the other items on
that list reached twenty phases. NAME THE EVENT, ASK WHAT GOES RED.

This check is what goes red.
