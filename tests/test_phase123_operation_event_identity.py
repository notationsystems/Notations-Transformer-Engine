"""Phase 123: operation event identity audit.

VERDICT: OPERATION IDENTITY IS UNDERDETERMINED.

Per the phase's own stop condition, the ledger is NOT designed. Nothing is
proposed, named, or reserved.

WHAT IS ALREADY DETERMINATE
----------------------------
Three of the five columns are answered, and answered by content-addressing:

    case                              artifact  evidence
    1  identical, executed twice      SAME      SAME
    2  same inputs, different seed    SAME      SAME
    3  different configuration        SAME      SAME
    4  different hardware             SAME      SAME
    5  interrupted and retried        SAME      SAME
    6  invoked concurrently twice     SAME      SAME
    7  invoked, never executed        none      none
    8  begins and raises              none      none
    9  succeeds, output rejected      SAME      none      <- Phase 121's orphan
    10 byte-identical to a prior run  SAME      SAME

Seed, configuration, hardware, retry and concurrency change NOTHING,
because none of them is an input to any hash. "Same state? same evidence?
same artifact?" are settled. ONLY "same event?" is open.

WHY IT IS OPEN -- EIGHT OF TEN CASES HAVE NO PURPOSE-INDEPENDENT ANSWER
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Each case was answered against five purposes a scientific instrument
might plausibly have. S = same event, D = different, N = no event.

    case                            repro  dedup  resource  failure  provenance
    1  identical, twice             D      S      D         D        S
    2  different seed               D      D      D         D        D
    3  different configuration      D      D      D         D        D
    4  different hardware           D      S      D         D        S
    5  interrupted and retried      S      S      D         D        S
    6  concurrent invocations       D      S      D         D        S
    7  invoked, never executed      N      N      N         D        N
    8  begins and raises            N      N      D         D        N
    9  output rejected              N      N      D         D        N
    10 byte-identical output        D      S      D         D        S

UNANIMOUS: 2 of 10. SPLIT: 8 of 10.

And the two unanimous cases contribute nothing. A changed seed or a
changed configuration is a changed INPUT, and every purpose distinguishes
different inputs -- that is INPUT identity, which content-addressing
already supplies. It is not operation identity.

Case 1 alone splits three ways: reproducibility says two events (you need
two independent runs to claim a reproduction), deduplication says one
(don't repeat work), resource accounting says two (two machine-hours),
provenance says one (one datum was admitted).

THE AXES DO NOT INTERSECT
--------------------------
    axis                repro  dedup  resource  failure  provenance
    invocation          --     --     --        REQ      --
    execution attempt   --     --     REQ       REQ      --
    execution instance  REQ    --     --        REQ      --
    configuration       REQ    REQ    --        --       --
    environment         REQ    --     REQ       REQ      --
    seed                REQ    REQ    --        --       --
    output              REQ    REQ    --        --       REQ
    wall-clock time     --     --     REQ       REQ      --
    causal parent       --     --     --        --       REQ
    retry lineage       --     --     --        REQ      --

    INTERSECTION: EMPTY.  UNION: all ten.

NOT ONE AXIS IS REQUIRED BY EVERY PURPOSE -- not `output`, which resource
accounting ignores; not `execution instance`, which deduplication and
provenance ignore. And the sets are NOT NESTED: deduplication needs
`seed`, which failure diagnosis does not; failure diagnosis needs
`invocation`, which reproducibility does not. Neither contains the other,
so there is no coarsest-common or finest-common relation to fall back on.

WHY THIS IS UNDERDETERMINATION AND NOT MERELY PLURALITY
---------------------------------------------------------
The competing option -- "multiple operation identities exist and cannot
share one carrier" -- is TRUE AS A DIAGNOSIS and is the reason for the
verdict, but it is not the verdict. It presupposes that each identity is
well-defined, which requires a purpose to be FIXED. The architecture fixes
none:

    Phase 114  the execution seam is a Protocol, specified and EMPTY, and
               its own docstring says no implementation shipped anywhere
               in this codebase is a live integration
    Phase 121  nothing in production looks for an attempt, an orphan, or
               an outcome
    Phase 122  every seam that could have captured an execution fact
               declines it, in four modules, in the same words

So there is no consumer whose question would select a relation. The
identity is not contested between two known parties; it is UNCLAIMED.
Designing a ledger now would mean choosing a purpose by fiat and then
discovering later that the real consumer needed a different one -- which
is precisely the failure mode Phases 107 through 110 kept finding when an
abstraction was named before its question was.

WHAT WOULD RESOLVE IT
----------------------
Not more analysis of the ten cases; they are exhausted and the answer is
stable. A single actual consumer, asking a question the evidence ledger
structurally cannot answer, would select a purpose, and the purpose would
select the axes. Until one exists, any equivalence relation is a guess
wearing a schema.

NOTHING IS PROPOSED. No ExecutionRecord, no OperationRecord, no
provenance event, no name reserved. Zero production changes. STOPPED at
the stop condition.
