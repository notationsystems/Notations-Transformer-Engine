"""Phase 118: dispatched measurement / execution boundary audit.

CENTRAL QUESTION: does the architecture distinguish "a measurement was
requested" from "a measurement was executed and produced a result"?

ANSWER: NO, and the failure is sharper than Phase 111's. Phase 111 needed
a caller to fabricate a Source/Document/Record chain and to WRITE a
plausible `extraction_method`. Here the claim is SUPPLIED BY A DEFAULT.

sec.12 THE FALSIFICATION, IN SIX LINES OF PUBLIC API
------------------------------------------------------
    value = 12345.6789                      # invented on this line
    rec = make_record(document_id=..., locator="run 1",
                      raw_content=str(value))
    admit_record(pool, rec); pool.put_record(rec)
    result = make_experimental_result(campaign, entry,
                 content={"property": ..., "value": value, "unit": "MPa"},
                 record_id=rec.id, extracted_at=...)   # NO extraction_method
    admit_experimental_result(pool, result, confidence=1.0)   # ACCEPTED

    result.extraction_method == "measurement:campaign_execution"

No dispatcher was called. No `ActionDispatcher` implementation exists
anywhere (Phase 114). The number was invented in the first line, and the
pool now holds it as a measurement produced by campaign execution, with a
`tested_during` ClaimedRelationship attaching it to the formulation.

sec.3 THE DEFAULT EXISTS TWICE
-------------------------------
    experiment/interface.py   DispatchedMeasurement.extraction_method
                              = "measurement:campaign_execution"
    materials/results.py      make_experimental_result(...,
                                extraction_method: str
                                = "measurement:campaign_execution")

The SECOND is the one that matters. `DispatchedMeasurement`'s default is
defensible -- a dispatcher is meant to measure. But `make_experimental_
result` carries the same default independently, so THE DISPATCHER CAN BE
BYPASSED ENTIRELY AND THE MEASUREMENT CLAIM STILL APPEARS. The value is
not a description of an observed event; it is an assertion made by a
constructor when the caller says nothing.

Every other default in this architecture defaults to UNKNOWN or to an
explicit refusal (`SelectionPolicy` has no defaults at all; `Prediction`
returns None rather than zero; `RankingPolicy.unknown_utility_policy` is
required). This is the one default that asserts the strongest available
claim on the caller's behalf.

sec.1/sec.7 THE CHAIN IS NOT THE CHAIN
----------------------------------------
The assumed shape --
    Campaign -> Dispatch -> Execution -> Result -> Observation
-- is not what the code does. `DispatchedMeasurement` has NO `id` and NO
`candidate_id`: it does not reference what it was dispatched for, and
nothing can reference it. `make_experimental_result(campaign, entry, ...)`
takes the candidate linkage from the CAMPAIGN ENTRY. The real shape is:

    Campaign --entry--------> ExperimentalResult --> Observation
    Dispatch --payload------->        ^
              (content, locator, raw_content, extracted_at, method)

DISPATCH IS A PAYLOAD SUPPLIER, NOT A LINK IN A PROVENANCE CHAIN. The
arrows mean, precisely: campaign->result is REFERENCED (`campaign_id`),
dispatch->result is COPIED (five fields, no reference retained),
result->observation is DERIVED (`admit_experimental_result` builds it),
observation->record is REFERENCED. None of them means CAUSED or PRODUCED.

sec.2 THE FOUR WORLDS
----------------------
  A requested + executed + result   an Observation
  B requested + never executed      NO OBJECT AT ALL. `dispatch()` is a
        plain method call; not calling it leaves no trace anywhere.
  C requested + execution failed    the exception propagates out of
        `run_experiment_step`. No failed-dispatch object, no partial
        state, nothing in the pool. FAILURE DISAPPEARS.
  D requested + fabricated result   INDISTINGUISHABLE FROM A.

B and C are unrepresentable; D is indistinguishable. So the substrate
does not distinguish request from execution from result -- it represents
only the fourth thing, the admitted value.

sec.5 FAILURE SEMANTICS: SIX OF SEVEN CASES ADMIT
---------------------------------------------------
    valid result            ACCEPTED
    NaN                     ACCEPTED
    infinity                ACCEPTED
    negative tensile strength ACCEPTED
    a string where a float belongs ACCEPTED
    missing `value` key     ACCEPTED
    empty content           ValueError (the only rejection)

And NaN PROPAGATES: a cell holding (NaN, 90.0) predicts mean=nan,
variance=nan. There is no `NaNDetectorHook` analogue, no clamp, no drift
monitor.

sec.9 THE ALCHEMI CONTRAST IS EXACT
-------------------------------------
    ALCHEMI                        here
    NaNDetectorHook   -> RAISES    NaN admits and propagates
    MaxForceClampHook -> REPAIRS   no analogue
    EnergyDriftMonitor-> WARNS     no analogue
    DynamicsStage (9 points)       one function call
    converged_mask (per sample)    no execution state at all

ALCHEMI can distinguish numerical failure from instability from physical
implausibility because its transition rule gives "the energy should be
conserved" a meaning. This subsystem has no transition rule beyond
appending, so it has nothing against which a value could be implausible.
That is consistent with Phase 116's finding and is not a defect of the
same kind -- but the ABSENCE OF ANY EXECUTION STATE is.

sec.6 DISPATCH IDENTITY DOES NOT EXIST
----------------------------------------
The question "can an operation go not-executed -> executed without a new
identity?" is malformed here in an informative way: `DispatchedMeasurement`
has no id, so there is no dispatch identity to conflate with execution
identity. Nothing is conflated because nothing is represented. What DOES
change identity is the CONTENT: `ExperimentalResult.id` hashes
campaign_id, candidate_id, formulation_id, property, content, record_id
and extraction_method -- so the same fabricated content under two
declared methods gives two results, and a genuine and a fabricated
measurement with the same content give ONE.

sec.11 DispatchedMeasurement HAS NO EVIDENTIAL STANDING
---------------------------------------------------------
It has no id, so no `put_*` can accept it and no object can cite it. It
cannot reach the pool as itself -- consistent with Phase 112b's
eighteen-objects finding. Its VALUES reach the pool by being copied into
a Record, which is Phase 111's route.

sec.14 CLASSIFICATION

  dispatch implies execution                  FALSIFIED -- dispatch is a
        method call; its absence and its failure are both untraceable
  execution implies result                    FALSIFIED -- an exception
        leaves nothing; there is no partial or failed result
  result implies measurement                  FALSIFIED -- sec.12
  "measurement:campaign_execution" is
        evidence-bearing                      FALSIFIED -- it is a
        constructor default, not an observation of an event
  extraction_method records actual origin     FALSIFIED (Phase 117,
        re-confirmed: here it records nothing, since nobody wrote it)
  failed execution is representable           FALSIFIED -- no state, no
        object, no record; failure disappears
  synthetic result is distinguishable         FALSIFIED -- byte-identical
  execution identity is independent of
        dispatch identity                     VACUOUS -- neither exists
  experiment and simulation remain
        distinguishable downstream            FALSIFIED -- both converge
        at the Record (Phase 117), and here the default actively
        mislabels the computational path as a measurement

SMALLEST GENUINELY UNREPRESENTED DISTINCTION
---------------------------------------------
Not "execution identity" (Phase 116b falsified the ExecutionRecord
candidate on three counts, and those counterexamples still hold).

It is narrower: THAT AN ATTEMPT OCCURRED AND HOW IT ENDED. Worlds B and C
have no representation at all, and that is the only thing in this audit
that is missing rather than merely unverifiable. Whether it should exist
is a separate question this phase was not asked and does not answer --
note only that adding it would not close sec.12, since a fabricator would
simply declare success, exactly as Phase 114 found for a dishonest
dispatcher.

WHAT THIS PHASE ACTUALLY ADDS TO PHASE 111
--------------------------------------------
A second, shorter route with a STRONGER default claim. In Phase 111 the
attacker had to write `extraction_method="regex:kv_v1"` -- a hedge. Here
the attacker writes nothing and the architecture supplies
"measurement:campaign_execution" on their behalf.

CONSEQUENCE FOR PRODUCTION: none. Zero production changes; nothing
repaired. Reported, not fixed, per the standing constraint.
