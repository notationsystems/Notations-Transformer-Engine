"""Phase 117: extraction semantics / measurement-computation boundary.

sec.15 FINAL PROPOSITION, AFTER ATTACK:

    `extraction_method` is A CALLER-DECLARED LABEL THAT IS
    IDENTITY-BEARING AND OTHERWISE ALMOST INERT. It is not provenance,
    not authenticity, not origin, and it does not distinguish
    measurement from computation. Its one behavioural effect raises the
    cost of one declaration and verifies nothing.

sec.1 THE COMPLETE CALL GRAPH
------------------------------
SIX construction sites, and every one PASSES A CALLER-SUPPLIED VALUE
THROUGH -- none derives it, none checks it:

    evidence/types.py:145      make_observation(extraction_method=...)
    materials/results.py:139   make_experimental_result(...)
    materials/results.py:173   from result.extraction_method
    experiment/step.py:172     from dispatched.extraction_method
    scout/extraction.py:90     from self.extraction_method
    scout/pipeline.py:147      from candidate.extraction_method

THREE consumers, and only one changes an outcome:

    evidence/admission.py:73   NON-EMPTINESS ONLY
    retrieval/epistemic.py:43  prefix dispatch -> a status string
    scout/pipeline.py:126      `startswith("model:")` and no confidence
                               -> REJECT (MISSING_MODEL_CONFIDENCE)

Nothing reads it in `materials/`, `experiment/` or `workbench/` beyond
passing it along. It affects no prediction, no candidate generation, no
comparability, no criterion evaluation, no retrieval scoring.

sec.2 IDENTITY-BEARING, BUT COARSER THAN IT LOOKS
--------------------------------------------------
Eleven method strings over one identical Record produce ELEVEN distinct
`Observation.id`s -- and only FOUR epistemic statuses. `Record.id`,
`Document.id` and `Source.id` are unchanged by all of them: the field
lives entirely at the Observation layer.

    model:...            -> inferred
    simulation:...       -> simulated
    human_transcription  -> observed
    EVERYTHING ELSE      -> extracted

So "measurement", "ocr", "manual", "regex", "unknown" AND "llm" all
classify as EXTRACTED -- "pulled from a Document/Record by a mechanical
process". An LLM is a GENERATOR, and an unprefixed `llm` is labelled an
extraction. The taxonomy is a prefix match with a fall-through, and the
fall-through is the strongest reading.

sec.4 THE FIELD DOES NOT IDENTIFY ORIGIN
-----------------------------------------
Of the five candidate meanings, it is the last:

    where the value came from        NO
    how the value was obtained       NO
    how it was serialized            NO
    how it was transformed           NO
    what the caller SAYS extracted it  YES

`measurement -> OCR -> observation` and
`arbitrary computation -> manual entry -> observation` are both a
caller writing a string. The field names the LAST HOP, and only as
declared.

sec.5 THE ONE MECHANISM, STATED PRECISELY
------------------------------------------
Every one of eleven method values admits identically; only the EMPTY
STRING is rejected (NO_EXTRACTION_METHOD). So the field is not an
epistemic firewall.

But it is not wholly inert, and flattening it to "descriptive metadata"
would be wrong. `scout/pipeline.py` enforces a COUPLING: declaring a
model obliges you to declare a confidence rather than let it default to
1.0. That rule RAISES the cost of one declaration and VERIFIES NOTHING
-- it does not check that a model was used, only that a model-claim
arrives with a number attached.

And it is PATH-SPECIFIC: `materials.results` and `experiment.step` never
apply it. Verified. That is the same "honest callers, not gates" pattern
Phase 111 found one layer down.

sec.8 A FABRICATED DECLARATION IS UNDETECTABLE IN PRINCIPLE
------------------------------------------------------------
    actual manual entry  declared "instrument:load_frame" -> extracted
    actual simulation    declared "human_transcription"   -> observed
    actual LLM output    declared "measurement:tensile"   -> extracted

Nothing in the system holds the first column. There is no field for what
ACTUALLY happened, so no mismatch is detectable -- not merely unchecked,
but unrepresentable. `extraction_method="OCR"` means exactly "the caller
says OCR", and nothing stronger.

sec.6 THE FOUR CASES CANNOT BE DISTINGUISHED WITHOUT THE STRING
----------------------------------------------------------------
    A instrument -> measured quantity
    B simulation -> computed quantity
    C fitted model -> estimated quantity
    D human assertion -> stated quantity

Strip `extraction_method` and all four are: a Record with raw content
under a locator in a Document from a Source, plus an Observation with
content and a confidence. IDENTICAL STRUCTURE. The distinction exists
nowhere else -- not on Record, not on Source, not on Document, not in
provenance, not in any operation object.

sec.7 WHERE THE TWO PIPELINES BECOME INDISTINGUISHABLE
--------------------------------------------------------
    physical event -> instrument -> raw data -> parser -> value -> Observation
    simulation     -> solver     -> output   -> parser -> value -> Observation

They become structurally identical AT THE RECORD. `Record(document_id,
locator, raw_content)` is the first object both pipelines can produce,
and from there forward every downstream object is the same type with the
same fields. THAT IS THE ACTUAL BOUNDARY, and it sits one layer BELOW
`extraction_method` -- which is why the field cannot police it.

sec.10 WHAT IS LOST
--------------------
Two Records built from a CSV and from a JSON, normalising to the same
locator and raw content, ARE THE SAME RECORD -- verified. Serialization
format, parser version, instrument settings, and the entire pipeline
above the Record are not represented. The METHOD survives (OCR and
manual give different Observation ids on one Record); everything
UPSTREAM of the Record does not.

That is INTENTIONAL CANONICALISATION at the Record layer and
UNREPRESENTED EXECUTION HISTORY above it -- the same split Phase 116b's
identity-invariance table found: identity tracks the record, never the
execution.

sec.11/sec.12 RELATION TO THE PRIOR RESULTS
---------------------------------------------
World A and World B (Phase 111b) can be made to differ in
`extraction_method` -- and a fabricator simply declares the honest
string. The field adds a distinguishable label, never a distinguishing
FACT. CONTENT IDENTITY CANNOT ESTABLISH AUTHENTICITY, unchanged.

The chain `execution identity -> extraction identity -> observation
identity` is NOT represented: the first term does not exist (Phase 115),
the second is a declared string, and only the third is real. The
converse -- same observation identity from different execution histories
-- is trivially constructible, since nothing upstream of the Record is
recorded.

sec.13 CARRIERS, ALL REJECTED
-------------------------------
  Extraction         would unify a parser invocation with a
                     transcription with a solver read. Cannot
                     distinguish generation from extraction, which is
                     the one distinction it is named for.
  Measurement        would assert an interaction with the world that the
                     architecture cannot witness (Phase 111b).
  Acquisition        `RawDocument`/`DispatchedMeasurement` already fill
                     this shape and are deliberately PRE-IDENTITY;
                     giving acquisition an identity would make an
                     unwitnessed act into a citable object.
  Transformation     would need to be identity-bearing to be useful and
                     would then put parser versions into evidence
                     identity -- re-parsing one document would orphan
                     every prior observation of it.
  ObservationOrigin  origin is precisely what is not representable.
  ProvenanceEvent    Phase 109: four membership semantics, two
                     contradictory.
  MeasurementRecord  fuses the Record layer (where the pipelines merge)
                     with a measurement claim (which they do not share).

sec.15 THREE COUNTEREXAMPLES TO THE SURVIVING PROPOSITION'S STRONGEST
RIVAL -- "extraction_method is provenance":

  1 It names the LAST HOP only. `simulation -> parser -> observation`
    declares the parser or the simulation at the caller's discretion,
    and both are equally admissible.
  2 It is unverifiable and unfalsifiable: nothing holds what actually
    happened, so no declaration can be wrong (sec.8).
  3 Real provenance is CONSTITUTIVE (Phase 109: dropping a
    `derived_from` input changes the id because the object IS a function
    of it). Changing `extraction_method` changes the id WITHOUT changing
    what the observation is a function of -- the content and the cited
    record are untouched. It is identity-bearing without being
    constitutive, which no provenance relation is.
