"""Locks on the record join that recovers what the projection drops.

THE DEFECT THIS ANSWERS is the acquisition layer's finding, verified in
this tree rather than taken on faith: `ComparisonGroup.values` is a bare
tuple of floats, so two properties measured on the same replicate runs
come back as two independent tuples with nothing to join them.

THE SHARPER HALF IS PINNED HERE. The unpairing is not an absence. A
group's values arrive ordered by CONTENT-ADDRESSED OBSERVATION ID
(`RetrievalResult.observation_ids` is `tuple(sorted(set(...)))`), and
two properties have different content, so the two tuples are two
unrelated permutations of the same runs. Index-pairing them therefore
succeeds and returns the wrong number -- on this data, wrong in SIGN,
stably, the same wrong number every run. An absence announces itself; a
confident wrong answer does not.

So the first tests below assert the trap STILL EXISTS. They are
characterization locks, not defect locks: the day the projection starts
carrying identity is the day this module should be reconsidered rather
than kept out of habit, and that day should arrive as a failing test.
