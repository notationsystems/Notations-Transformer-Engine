"""Phase 72: proves the workbench is a general experimental workbench,
not a polished two-candidate demonstration -- a research session with
FOUR candidates spanning TWO formulations and TWO experimental contexts
(the phase's own minimum ask was three; two formulations x two contexts
is the natural, unmodified product of `materials.candidates.
generate_candidates` given two formulations and two criteria, and
additionally yields a fourth, never-touched "control" candidate that
strengthens every isolation assertion below).

INVESTIGATION (Phase 72 sec. "Audit the current workbench", re-read
fresh: `workbench/interaction.py`, `workbench/cli.py`, `workbench/
investigation.py`, `workbench/demo.py`, `experiment/session.py`,
`experiment/step.py`, `materials/candidates.py`, `materials/model_
state.py`, `materials/information.py`, `materials/utility.py`,
`materials/ranking.py`, `materials/optimization.py`, and every existing
workbench/experiment test):

`workbench.interaction.bootstrap_multi_candidate_scenario` produces
exactly two candidates ONLY because it supplies exactly two `Criterion`
objects for exactly one formulation -- nothing in `materials.candidates.
generate_candidates` (`_action_group_key` groups by formulation.id,
property, role, action_class, and content_hash(criterion_context) --
formulation is the FIRST field), `materials.model_state.
resolve_model_state_key` (keyed by formulation_id, property, and
target_context), `WorkbenchState` (holds a plain `CandidateSet` of
whatever length; `select_candidate`/`list_candidates`/`decide`/
`information_value_estimate` all iterate generically), or `workbench.
cli` (every `_cmd_*`/`format_*` function iterates `state.list_
candidates()` with no length assumption -- confirmed by direct
inspection, not by trying it and hoping) imposes any two-candidate
limit. `bootstrap_multi_candidate_scenario` is confirmed, empirically
and by source inspection, to be MERELY a fixture -- not the definition
of what a "research session" can be. Per the phase's own stop
condition, none of its five conditions for adding a new abstraction are
met (existing operations already express the required semantics;
caller composition already suffices; nothing belongs at a missing
interaction boundary; existing identity/state/provenance already
express multi-formulation/multi-context candidates; nothing would be
duplicated) -- so this file adds NO production abstraction. The
scenario-construction helper below (`_bootstrap_research_scenario`) is
TEST-ONLY, living here rather than in `workbench/interaction.py`,
precisely to keep that finding honest: `workbench/interaction.py`,
`workbench/cli.py`, `materials/`, `experiment/`, and `core/` are all
byte-for-byte unchanged by this phase.
