"""VerificationPolicy: the proof-cost dial, as a deterministic controller.

Stage 6 measured the ladder -- native ~ms, Nexus ~15 s, RISC Zero ~65 s,
SP1 ~300 s -- and proved evidence identity is blind to the warrant.
Stage 7 turns that into a decision mechanism ABOVE the substrate:

    ProofBackend        = capability   (unchanged)
    VerificationPolicy  = decision     (this module)
    VerifiedExecution   = earned result (unchanged)
    EvidencePool        = scientific state (untouched)
    OperationTrace      = machine history  (untouched)

THE POLICY SELECTS A WARRANT. It cannot manufacture one (every verified
outcome still comes through `prove_and_verify_result`, i.e. real proof +
sealed verification + host recomputation), cannot weaken one (a failed
lane is recorded as failed, never relabeled), and cannot touch evidence
(warrant records live in campaign metadata; nothing here writes a field
an Observation carries).

DETERMINISM: sampling is content-driven, not random -- whether a
specification draws an independent or heavyweight sample is a pure
function of (policy identity, spec identity, role), so a rerun of the
same campaign under the same policy makes identical decisions. A policy
is itself scientific configuration and is content-addressed
(`scout.campaign.verification-policy.v1`).

ESCALATION (deterministic, smallest useful ruleset): a failed routine
lane escalates to the independent lane; a failed independent escalates
to the heavyweight lane; if every attempted lane fails, the dispatch
FAILS (the seam records it; nothing is admitted). An escalated success
is recorded AS escalated -- the earlier failure stays in the record,
never silently absorbed. An unavailable lane (backend not built here)
is recorded as `unavailable` and skipped: optional expensive verifiers
being absent must not stop the campaign (Stage 7 invariant 9), and
skipping is visibly different from verifying.
