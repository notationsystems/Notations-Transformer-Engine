"""Warrant prefetch: parallel proof MANUFACTURE, never parallel trust.

Stage 8 measured where campaign time goes once warrants are reusable:
proving genuinely new statements is >96% of wall in every arm, it runs
strictly serially, and one Nexus prover uses only ~half of this
machine. The reducible cost left is therefore not WHAT we prove but
WHEN: independent statements can be proven concurrently.

This module is deliberately upstream of everything trusted:

    plan      = pure function of (policy identity, points, lanes)
    workers   = N concurrent (native run -> prove -> host verify -> store)
    output    = WarrantCache entries -- content-addressed BYTES

and nothing else. The prefetcher:

  - never touches EvidencePool or OperationTrace (structurally: it is
    not handed them);
  - never creates WarrantRecords (records belong to the campaign's own
    dispatches);
  - never lets anything consume its artifacts without the Stage 8 gate:
    a campaign hit on a prefetched warrant still goes through
    `verify_existing_proof`, mandatorily, like any other hit.

So the campaign after a prefetch is byte-for-byte the campaign without
one -- same seam, same records modulo cache-state, same evidence -- it
just finds the proofs already manufactured.

The native execution a worker runs to build the statement is warrant
manufacture (exactly like the zkVM guest's own re-execution of the
computation), not a scientific dispatch: it produces no occurrence and
no evidence. The campaign's dispatch remains the only place occurrences
and observations come from.

Failure semantics: a failed task is REPORTED and its key left absent --
the campaign then handles that statement through the unchanged inline
semantics (miss -> prove fresh, or fail the lane attributably). Prefetch
can therefore only ever add artifacts, never subtract behavior.

Determinism: the PLAN is deterministic (same policy, points and lanes
-> same task set, in statement-key order). Worker completion order is
not, and nothing downstream can see it: artifacts are content-addressed
and the campaign's decisions read only (policy, spec) identities.
