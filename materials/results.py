"""ExperimentalResult + admit_experimental_result: the bridge between an
executed campaign entry and new SCOUT evidence -- the first point in
this entire pipeline where the flow reverses direction. Every layer
since `materials.analysis` has been READ-ONLY over `EvidencePool`; this
module is the one place that WRITES to it, and it does so using nothing
but the existing, unmodified public admission API
(`evidence.admission.admit_observation`/`admit_claimed_relationship`,
`evidence.types.make_observation`/`make_claimed_relationship`). No new
evidence type, no parallel store, no substrate modification.

Before writing this module, the existing admission API was inspected end
to end (`evidence.types.Observation`/`Source`/`Document`/`Record`/
`Referent`/`ClaimedRelationship`, every `admit_*` gate in
`evidence.admission`, and -- critically -- how `materials.analysis.analyze`
and `retrieval.engine.DeterministicRetrievalEngine` actually decide an
Observation is "about" a Referent). The answer: an Observation only
becomes visible to `analyze()` when a `ClaimedRelationship` connects the
queried Referent to some other, already-admitted Referent, with that
relationship's `observation_id` set to the new Observation -- exactly
the `tested_during` pattern every workload fixture in this repository
has already used since Phase 30. This is not a new discovery; it is
confirmed directly by reading `retrieval/engine.py`'s
`_bounded_neighborhood`/`retrieve`: a relationship is only retrieved
when BOTH its endpoints are already-admitted Referents within the
traversal, and `analyze()`'s own query places no restriction on
relationship `type`, so `tested_during` is a realistic default, never a
structural requirement enforced by this module.

Two concepts, kept as separate as Phase 39-41 kept eligibility/selection
and specified/inherited parameters:

  ExperimentalResult -- an application-level description of what was
  actually obtained: which campaign/candidate produced it, which
  formulation/property it concerns, and the measured content (an open
  `Mapping[str, object]`, exactly `Observation.content`'s own shape --
  no new schema is invented beyond what the caller supplies). Building
  one touches `EvidencePool` not at all.

  admit_experimental_result -- the only thing that ever mutates the
  pool: constructs a genuine, new `Observation` from the result's
  content and a caller-provided `record_id` (the caller is responsible
  for having already admitted the Source/Document/Record chain this
  measurement was transcribed into -- this module reuses that existing
  mechanism rather than inventing a second one), admits it through the
  unmodified `admit_observation` gate, then connects it to the result's
  formulation via a `ClaimedRelationship` to the already-admitted
  process Referent (resolved by natural key, reusing
  `materials.analysis._resolve_referent` rather than duplicating that
  scan), admitted through the unmodified `admit_claimed_relationship`
  gate. Confidence is never invented here or defaulted: it is a
  required parameter to `admit_experimental_result`, exactly the same
  discipline `evidence.admission.admit_observation`'s own docstring
  establishes for every extraction.

No quality score, confidence score (beyond the one SCOUT's own
Observation type already requires to admit anything at all), probability,
utility, expected-information-gain, ranking, or automatic interpretation
is added anywhere in this module. `ExperimentalResult` represents what
was obtained, not what the system believes about it.
