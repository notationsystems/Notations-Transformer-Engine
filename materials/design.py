"""assemble_experimental_design(plan, ...) -> ExperimentalDesign: the
first experimental-design representation layer above materials.plan.

An `ActionCandidate` says WHAT KIND of evidence-acquisition action was
selected (`action_class`, a generic domain+specificity tag like
"measurement:repeat"). An `ExperimentalDesign` says WHAT PARAMETERS have
been specified for carrying that action out. This module represents
those parameters; it never decides them, ranks them, or optimizes them.

Before writing this module, every upstream structure an
ExperimentalDesign could draw from was inspected
(`materials/plan.py::ExperimentPlanEntry`, `materials/candidates.py::
ActionCandidate`, `materials/specification.py::EvidenceRequirement`) to
determine exactly what design-relevant information already exists,
rather than assuming any of it. The answer: exactly ONE field anywhere
in the existing pipeline has the shape of an experimental-design
parameter set -- `ActionCandidate.target_context` (== the triggering
`EvidenceRequirement.criterion_context`, an open `Mapping[str, object]`
of condition keys a caller already declared, e.g. `{"temperature": 25,
"temperature_unit": "C"}`). Nothing else scientifically useful for a
design -- measurement method, model-validation method, instrument,
replicate count, composition, process condition -- exists anywhere
upstream: `action_class` names a DOMAIN, not a method; `EvidenceRequirement`
carries a formulation identity but no composition breakdown; process
identity exists only at the top-level `process_natural_key` a query was
run against (Phase 31 onward), never attached to an individual
requirement/candidate/plan entry. None of those is fabricated here.

Every design entry therefore distinguishes exactly three kinds of
information, never blurring them:

  inherited_parameters -- copied verbatim from `ActionCandidate.
  target_context` via the embedded `ExperimentPlanEntry`. The only
  parameter data the architecture can actually justify without a caller
  supplying anything.

  specified_parameters -- an open `Mapping[str, object]` the CALLER
  explicitly supplies at design-assembly time (e.g. replicate_count,
  instrument, method). This module places no schema or validation on
  the values -- exactly the same open-content discipline
  `Observation.content`/`Criterion.context`/`DerivedValue.content`
  already establish -- because inventing a schema here would be
  inventing the laboratory ontology this phase explicitly forbids.

  unspecified_parameter_keys -- parameter keys the CALLER explicitly
  flags as known-to-matter but not yet determined. This module never
  infers this set on its own (there is no way to enumerate "what a
  design should specify" without inventing domain knowledge) -- a
  parameter simply absent from both `specified_parameters` and
  `unspecified_parameter_keys` is neither claimed determined nor
  claimed pending; it was never mentioned at all, which is itself an
  honest, distinct state from either.

A key may not appear in both `specified_parameters` and
`unspecified_parameter_keys` at once -- that is a caller contradiction,
rejected rather than silently resolved.

Provenance: `ExperimentalDesignEntry.plan_entry` embeds the complete,
unmodified `ExperimentPlanEntry` -- which itself already embeds the
complete `CandidateSelection` -> `CandidateEvaluation` -> `ActionCandidate`
-> targeted `EvidenceRequirement`s (Phase 37-40's own chain). Nothing is
duplicated or recomputed here; the full
ExperimentPlanEntry->CandidateSelection->CandidateEvaluation->
ActionCandidate->EvidenceRequirement->EvidenceGap chain this phase asks
for is already reachable by walking that one embedded object.

No new identity is introduced: ordering and identity both reuse
`plan_entry.candidate_id` (== the untouched `ActionCandidate.id` from
Phase 37) -- the same "reuse the existing canonical id rather than
minting a new one" choice every layer since Phase 38 has already made.
