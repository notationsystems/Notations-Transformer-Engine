"""estimate_information_value(candidate, current_iteration, model) ->
InformationValueEstimate: a formal, caller-supplied model SEAM for
turning `materials.value`'s structural facts about a candidate into an
epistemic number -- expected information gain, posterior entropy
reduction, expected variance reduction, expected improvement, mutual
information, or whatever a future scientific model computes. This
module implements NONE of those algorithms; it only defines the
interface a future one would plug into, and ships exactly one reference
implementation (`NullInformationValueModel`) that always returns
NOT_DETERMINABLE, proving the plumbing without making any scientific
claim.

THE ARCHITECTURAL DISTINCTION THIS MODULE EXISTS TO PRESERVE: the
materials application already knows WHAT information is missing
(`materials.experiment`'s gap categories), WHAT would close it
(`materials.specification`'s requirements), and WHAT possible actions
could obtain it (`materials.candidates`) -- but nothing anywhere in
`materials/analysis.py` through `materials/candidates.py` (inspected
before writing this module, along with `materials/value.py`,
`materials/evaluation.py`, `materials/decision.py`) knows HOW VALUABLE
resolving a given gap is. `materials.value.CandidateInformationValue`
already draws this line correctly (`expected_information_gain` is
always `NOT_DETERMINABLE` there too) -- this module does not change
that; it adds the one thing Phase 46 deliberately left as a seam: a
place a real model can be plugged in.

`InformationValueModel` is a `Protocol` -- the exact same extension-seam
pattern `retrieval.engine.RetrievalEngine` already establishes for
retrieval quality: a future SurrogateModelInformationValue /
PosteriorEntropyInformationValue / ExpectedImprovementInformationValue
implements this same interface and this module never changes underneath
it. `estimate()` receives ONLY the already-computed
`CandidateInformationValue` (Phase 46's structural facts) -- never
`EvidencePool`, never `RetrievalEngine`, never raw `Observation`/
`DerivedValue` objects. This is the hard boundary: a model may use
whatever mathematics or external knowledge it has, but it may not reach
back into the substrate itself, and this module's own code never
computes a number from `information_value.property`, `.criterion`,
`.current_status` (PASS/FAIL/etc.), the number of observations, a
candidate's rank, its utility, or its `action_class` -- those are
structural facts a MODEL may choose to consume, but none of them is by
itself sufficient grounds for a value estimate, and this module never
treats them as if it were.

Two states, reusing `materials.utility.NOT_DETERMINABLE` directly (not
redefined): `ESTIMATED` (the model returned a number) and
`NOT_DETERMINABLE` (it returned `None` -- its own honest "I cannot
produce this," never defaulted to zero or inferred from anything else).

Each `InformationValueEstimate` embeds the complete, unmodified
`CandidateInformationValue` -- the full candidate -> requirement -> gap
-> audit -> decision -> evidence/provenance chain stays reachable
without duplicating any of it. No new identity system: `candidate_id`
is exactly `ActionCandidate.id`, untouched since Phase 37.

No ranking, optimization, utility, recommendation, experiment
selection, Bayesian optimization, active learning, LLM call, database
write, or `EvidencePool` access exists anywhere in this module.
`materials.results` remains the sole write boundary.
