# Architecture (as built)

This describes how the implementation maps onto
`docs/ARCHITECTURE_SPEC.md` ("Deterministic State Architecture — Frozen
Specification v1.0.0"). Read that document first; this one is a map from
its sections to the actual code, plus the concrete data flow through it.
For the three small grammar inconsistencies found in the spec itself
during implementation and how they were resolved, see
`docs/CONTRADICTIONS.md`.

```

**`adapters/` is not part of the original frozen specification.** It was
added in a later session, on explicit request, to establish an
external-data ingestion boundary: `Adapter.normalize()` turns an
`ExternalRecord` into the same `CandidateChange` shape `validate_candidate`
already accepts — it does not modify `validate_candidate`,
`CanonicalState`, or any invariant, it only adds one more optional
*producer* of a shape that already existed. It's flagged here rather than
silently presented as if `docs/ARCHITECTURE_SPEC.md` had always specified
it. `adapters/json_adapter.py` and `adapters/csv_adapter.py` (Phase 12)
are real adapters built on that interface — see
`docs/DATA_CAPABILITIES.md` for exactly what data shapes they handle and
`tests/test_data_ingestion.py` for the full external-data -> canonical
-> Morpho -> backend trace. Both are additive in the same sense as the
interface itself: neither imports or calls `validate_candidate`,
`make_version`, or `create_genesis_version` (checked by
`tests/test_data_ingestion.py::test_adapters_never_import_validation_or_mint_machinery`).

**`evidence/` and `scout/` are also not part of the original frozen
specification.** They implement the (previously research-only)
evidence-pool design from `docs/PHASE_14_DATA_POOL_ARCHITECTURE.md`:
`evidence/` is a separate object domain (`Source`, `Document`, `Record`,
`Observation`, `Referent`, `ClaimedRelationship`) with its own
content-addressed identity, its own admission gate
(`evidence/admission.py`), and its own derived graph view
(`evidence/trust_graph.py`) — structurally similar to
`core.canonical`/`validate_candidate`/Morpho but never the same objects,
and never reachable from `core.canonical` in either direction (`core/`
does not import `evidence/`; `evidence/` does not import
`core.canonical.validation`). `scout/` is a producer built on top of
`evidence/`, in the same relationship `adapters/` has to
`core.canonical`. Full contract, network metrics, and FEP-facing
interface: `docs/SCOUT_ARCHITECTURE.md`. Neither package calls
`validate_candidate` or constructs a `CanonicalState`/`Version` — see
`tests/test_scout_boundaries.py`.

**`retrieval/` is the next layer downstream of `evidence/`, also not
part of the original frozen specification.** It is deterministic and
strictly read-only: `RetrievalQuery -> RetrievalEngine ->
RetrievalResult -> ContextPackage`, plus a deliberately minimal
`InquirySeam` marking (not implementing) the boundary toward a future
`InquiryState`. It consumes `evidence.pool.EvidencePool` and
`evidence.trust_graph.build_trust_graph` exactly as they already
existed, plus one additive, pure, read-only method added to
`EvidencePool` this phase (`fingerprint()` — a content hash of the
pool's current object ids, used to detect when evidence has changed
between two retrievals). `retrieval/` never imports
`core.canonical.validation`, never calls `validate_candidate`, and never
calls any of `EvidencePool`'s `put_*` mutators — see
`tests/test_retrieval_boundaries.py`. Full contract, capability list,
and authority-boundary table: `docs/RETRIEVAL_ARCHITECTURE.md`.

**One additive extension to core was made alongside them (Phase 12):**
`core/canonical/version.py::ProvenanceInfo` gained an optional
`timestamp: Optional[str] = None` field, so an adapter can preserve a
per-measurement timestamp when the source data supplies one explicitly
(as opposed to `Version.timestamp`, which records when a version was
*accepted*). This mirrors a field `morpho/provenance.py::ProvenanceRecord`
already had. It is backward compatible by construction (defaulted,
excluded from the `Version.id` content hash per §4) and was documented
before implementation, not applied silently.

Enforced rules (checked by `tests/test_architecture_boundaries.py`,
which walks the actual `import`/`from ... import` statements in every
`.py` file under each package — not a hand-maintained list):

- `core/` never imports `morpho/`, `backends/`, or `runtime/`.
- `morpho/` never imports `backends/` or `runtime/`.
- `backends/threejs`, `backends/diagram`, `backends/graph`,
  `backends/simulation`, `backends/neural` never import each other.
  (`CandidateNextState`, needed by both `backends/simulation/interface.py`
  and `backends/neural/interface.py`, lives in `core/canonical/delta.py`
  — upstream of both — specifically so neither backend has to import the
  other; see that file's docstring.)
- Nothing under `core/`, `morpho/`, `backends/`, or `runtime/` imports
  `renderer/` (it isn't Python at all; it's the terminal JSON consumer).
- `core/canonical/validation.py` (the only function that may mint a
  `CanonicalState`/`Version`, §6) imports nothing from `morpho/` or
  `backends/` — checked directly in
  `core/canonical/test_validation.py::test_validation_module_has_no_dependency_on_morpho`.
- `backends/threejs/compiler.py` imports nothing from
  `core.canonical.validation` or `core.canonical.version` — checked in
  `tests/test_backends_threejs.py::test_threejs_backend_cannot_become_source_of_truth`.

## Data flow, concretely

```python
schema = StateSchema(...)                                  # core/canonical/schema.py
v0 = create_genesis_version(schema, timestamp)              # core/canonical/version.py
                                                               #   (the ONLY Version built
                                                               #    outside validate_candidate)

candidate = CandidateDelta(version_from=v0.id, changes=(...))  # core/canonical/delta.py
result = validate_candidate(schema, v0.state, candidate)        # core/canonical/validation.py
# result: Version | list[ValidationError] -- atomic, never partial

projected = project_state(result)                                 # core/projection/project.py
                                                                     #   pure, deterministic

ir_doc = compile_morpho(projected, CompilerConfig())                 # morpho/compiler.py
                                                                        #   pure, deterministic

scene = compile_threejs(ir_doc, ThreeJSRenderConfig())                  # backends/threejs/compiler.py
svg = compile_svg(ir_doc, DiagramLayoutConfig())                         # backends/diagram/compiler.py
report = analyze(ir_doc)                                                  # backends/graph/analysis.py
```

`renderer/index.html` then `fetch()`es a serialized `scene` (see
`scripts/generate_sample_scene.py`) and builds/updates `THREE.*` objects
from it. There is no function call from that page back into any of the
above.

The simulation/neural feedback path re-enters at the same door:

```python
candidate = simulator.step(dynamics_spec, action)     # -> CandidateNextState (backends/simulation/interface.py)
result = submit_simulation_candidate(                  # runtime/feedback_loop.py
    schema, base_state, candidate, tx_id, timestamp
)                                                         # internally just builds a
                                                            # CandidateDelta and calls
                                                            # validate_candidate -- same
                                                            # function, same atomicity
```

## Determinism, concretely

- `Version.id` = `sha256(canonical_json(schema_version, fields, edges))`,
  where `canonical_json` sorts all map keys and uses fixed JSON
  separators (`core/canonical/version.py::canonical_json_bytes`).
- `project_state`, `compile_morpho`, `compile_threejs`, and `compile_svg`
  never branch on wall-clock time, randomness, or object identity/`id()`;
  where output order is observable (Morpho entity order, scene mesh
  order, SVG element order), iteration is always over explicitly
  `sorted()` keys, never raw `dict`/`set` iteration order.
- This was checked by running the full genesis-to-scene pipeline three
  times under `PYTHONHASHSEED=0`, `1`, and `12345` in separate process
  invocations and diffing the outputs (identical `Version.id` and mesh-id
  ordering in all three).
