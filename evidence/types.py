"""Pool object types (`docs/PHASE_14_DATA_POOL_ARCHITECTURE.md` §B/§D).

Naming deliberately follows that document's own collision warning:
`Referent` (not `Entity` -- `morpho/ir.py` already owns that name) and
`ClaimedRelationship` (not `Relationship` -- ditto for `MorphoRelation`).

Every type here is immutable once constructed, exactly like
`core/canonical/state.py`'s `Field`/`EdgeRecord`/`CanonicalState`: an
"update" is always a *new* object referencing its predecessor by id,
never an in-place edit. Nothing in this module is ever deleted by
anything in this repository -- see `evidence/pool.py`.

The ONLY supported way to construct one of these is its `make_*`
factory below -- exactly the discipline `core/canonical/version.py`'s
`make_version` already establishes ("the id is always derived from
content, never supplied by the caller, so an object's id can never
disagree with its own content"). Constructing a dataclass directly with
a hand-picked `id` bypasses that guarantee and is a caller error, not a
supported path.

    -- never `confidence` or `derived_at`, the same discipline
    `Observation` already establishes and for the same reason: a
    re-derivation with the identical inputs/method/content is the same
    fact, even if its confidence or the moment it was recorded differs.

    `derived_from` may reference Observation ids, DerivedValue ids, or a

    be superseded by a better derivation"). Referential integrity (do the

    the same split `make_claimed_relationship`/`admit_claimed_relationship`

    A derivation cycle (A referencing B, B referencing A) cannot exist at
    all, for a reason more fundamental than admission ordering: `id` is
    computed from `content_hash({derived_from, ...})`, so a `derived_from`
    containing the other object's id requires that id to already be a
    concrete value. Two objects whose `derived_from` each named the

    the mutual dependency has no resolution, independent of whether
    admission is ever consulted. Admission's own, separate job is
    narrower: rejecting a *dangling* reference to an id that was never
