"""EvidencePool: in-memory, append-only store for pool objects.

Same shape as `core/canonical/version.py::InMemoryVersionStore` --
single-writer, in-process, v1 only (§S: no real database is implied or
required yet). The one deliberate difference: `VersionStore` has one
head; `EvidencePool` has none, because unlike `CanonicalState` there is
no single "current" evidence state -- conflicting, coexisting
Observations are the point (§E), not a bug to resolve here.

Nothing is ever deleted. Because every id is content-addressed
(`evidence/identity.py`), re-putting an object that already exists is a
no-op by construction -- there is no way to construct two *different*
objects that collide on the same id, so unlike
`core.canonical.state.CanonicalState`'s `fields[key].id` check, there is
no possible mismatch to detect here.
